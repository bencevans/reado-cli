You're likely using npm start to run your app, well if your "main" file isn't what suits your app structure to start the app then overwrite the command using a script!

As the npm documentation states, using the override for install is discouraged. Here the  prepublish override should be used so that a module is all packed up and ready to use when the module is installed.
